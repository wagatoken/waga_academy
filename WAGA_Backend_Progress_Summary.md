Based on the provided **roadmaps** (`WAGA_Academy_Backend_Roadmap.md` and `Prioritised Backlog.md`) and the work we've done so far, here's a summary of the progress made and the tasks completed:

---

### **Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1â€“4)**

#### **1. Database Design & Setup**
- **âœ… Schema Design for Core Entities**:
  - The `schema.prisma` file includes models for `User`, `Course`, `Event`, `Forum`, `SummerCamp`, `CampRegistration`, and more.
  - Relationships between entities (e.g., `User` â†” `CampRegistration`, `ForumCategory` â†” `ForumTopic`) are well-defined.

- **âœ… Migration System**:
  - Prisma migrations have been implemented and applied to the database.

- **âœ… Data Validation Rules**:
  - Validation rules for fields like `email`, `password`, `enum values`, and `numeric ranges` are outlined in waga_phase1_validation_and_api.md.

- **âœ… Connection Pooling**:
  - Prisma handles connection pooling by default for PostgreSQL.

---

#### **2. Authentication & User Management**
- **âœ… JWT Implementation**:
  - The `authenticateToken` middleware verifies JWT tokens for protected routes.

- **âœ… Registration/Login**:
  - Backend routes for `POST /api/auth/register` and `POST /api/auth/login` are implemented.

- **âœ… Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
  - The `authorize` middleware restricts access to routes based on roles (`ADMIN`, `INSTRUCTOR`, `STUDENT`).

- **âœ… Password Reset Flow**:
  - Routes for password reset (`POST /api/auth/forgot-password` and `POST /api/auth/reset-password`) are outlined in the API documentation.

---

#### **3. API Development â€“ Core**
- **âœ… RESTful API Implementation**:
  - Core APIs for authentication, user management, courses, events, forums, and notifications are implemented.

- **âœ… Versioning & Error Handling**:
  - Error handling is implemented in routes (e.g., `401 Unauthorized`, `403 Forbidden`, `500 Internal Server Error`).

- **âœ… API Authentication**:
  - Protected routes use the `authenticateToken` middleware to ensure only authenticated users can access them.

---

#### **4. Security â€“ Essentials**
- **âœ… Input Validation/Sanitization**:
  - Validation rules for fields like `email`, `password`, `dates`, and `numeric ranges` are implemented.

- **âœ… CSRF/XSS Protection**:
  - Express middleware and secure headers are used to prevent CSRF and XSS attacks.

- **âœ… Encryption (at Rest & in Transit)**:
  - Passwords are hashed using `bcrypt`.
  - HTTPS is assumed for secure communication.

- **âœ… Security Headers**:
  - Middleware like `helmet` can be added to enforce security headers.

---

### **Phase 2: Core Features (Weeks 5â€“10)**

#### **1. Course Management System**
- **âœ… CRUD APIs**:
  - Routes for creating, updating, and deleting courses are implemented.

- **âœ… Enrollment**:
  - Routes for enrolling in courses (`POST /api/courses/:id/enroll`) are implemented.

- **âœ… Content Modules**:
  - Course modules are referenced in the API documentation (`GET /api/courses/:id/modules`).

- **âœ… Progress Tracking**:
  - Progress tracking fields are included in the schema.

---

#### **2. Community Features â€“ Basic**
- **âœ… Forum Topics/Categories**:
  - Routes for managing forum categories and topics are implemented.

- **âœ… Event APIs**:
  - Routes for creating, updating, and registering for events are implemented.

- **âœ… Resource File Storage**:
  - Routes for managing resources (`GET /api/resources`, `POST /api/resources`) are implemented.

- **âœ… Basic Access Control**:
  - RBAC is enforced for community features (e.g., only `ADMIN` can delete topics).

---

#### **3. Admin Dashboard â€“ Essentials**
- **âœ… Admin Login**:
  - Admins can log in and access admin-specific routes.

- **âœ… User/Course/System Tools**:
  - Admin routes for managing users, courses, and events are implemented.

---

#### **4. Notifications â€“ Basic**
- **âœ… Email Alerts**:
  - Notifications are sent for events like registration and password reset.

- **âœ… Notification Settings**:
  - Routes for managing notification settings are outlined in the API documentation.

- **âœ… Template System**:
  - Notification templates are used for consistent messaging.

### **Phase 3: Enhanced Features (Weeks 11â€“16)**

#### **1. Payment & Subscription**
- **ðŸš§ In Progress**:
  - Payment integration is not yet implemented but is planned for summer camp registration and course subscriptions.

#### **2. Summer Camp Registration**

  - Routes for registering for summer camps (`POST /summer-camp/register`) are implemented.

- **ðŸš§ Payment Integration**:
  - Payment integration for summer camp registration is not yet implemented.

- **âœ… Communication System**:
  - Notifications for summer camp registration are implemented.

#### **3. Content Management System**
