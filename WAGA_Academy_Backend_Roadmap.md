## ‚úÖ Implementation Recommendations

- Start with **monolith architecture** ‚Üí later refactor into microservices
- Use **feature flags** to gradually roll out new features
- Implement **automated testing** early
- Use **infrastructure as code (IaC)** to manage environments
- Add **monitoring and logging** from the start
